Keyboard
========

The keyboard peripheral directly interfaces to the host computer's keyboard,
and has two :ref:`I/O ports <keyboard-io>` associated with it.

.. _keyboard-io:

.. index::
	pair: Keyboard; IO Ports

I/O Ports
---------

There are two I/O ports associated with the keyboard, the status port ``0x64``
and the control/data port ``0x60``

.. index::
	pair: Keyboard; Status Port

Status Port
^^^^^^^^^^^

The status port, ``0x64`` is used to read information about the current state
of the keyboard.

.. _keyboard-status-port:
.. table:: Status Port (\ ``0x64``\ )

	+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+----------+
	| Bit 7      | Bit 6      | Bit 5      | Bit 4      | Bit 3      | Bit 2      | Bit 1      | Bit 0    |
	+============+============+============+============+============+============+============+==========+
	| *reserved* | *reserved* | *reserved* | *reserved* | *reserved* | *reserved* | *reserved* | *DRDY*   |
	+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+----------+

.. _keyboard-drdy:

**DRDY** - Data ready
	When set, indicates that the data register holds a character to be read from
	the keyboard. If clear, the data register contents are undefined.

	This flag will be cleared when the data register is read.

.. index::
	pair: Keyboard; Control Port
	pair: Keyboard; Data Port

Control/Data Port
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The control port and data port share the same address, ``0x60``. When an I/O
write to port ``0x60`` occurs, the contents will be written to the control port.
When an I/O read from port ``0x60`` occurs, the contents of the data port will
be read.

.. _keyboard-control-port:
.. table:: Control Port (\ ``0x60``\ , Write Only)

	+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+----------+
	| Bit 7      | Bit 6      | Bit 5      | Bit 4      | Bit 3      | Bit 2      | Bit 1      | Bit 0    |
	+============+============+============+============+============+============+============+==========+
	| *reserved* | *reserved* | *reserved* | *KBIE*     | *reserved* | *reserved* | *reserved* | *KBEN*   |
	+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+----------+

**KBIE** - Keyboard Interrupt Enable
	When set, IRQ 9 will be triggered each time a keypress is detected,
	regardless of whether the previous key has been read from the data
	buffer.

.. _keyboard-kben:

**KBEN** - Keyboard Enable
	When set, the keyboard will respond to keypresses. When clear, this device
	is disabled, and no state changes or interrupts will occur.

.. _keyboard-data-port:
.. table:: Data Port (\ ``0x60``\ , Read Only)

	+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+----------+
	| Bit 7      | Bit 6      | Bit 5      | Bit 4      | Bit 3      | Bit 2      | Bit 1      | Bit 0    |
	+============+============+============+============+============+============+============+==========+
	| *DATA7*    | *DATA6*    | *DATA5*    | *DATA4*    | *DATA3*    | *DATA2*    | *DATA1*    | *DATA0*  |
	+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+----------+

**DATA[0:7]** - Keyboard Character Data
	When :ref:`DRDY <keyboard-drdy>` is set, DATA contains a valid ASCII
	character that is ready to read. This register will not be modified
	until a read has been performed, at which point :ref:`DRDY <keyboard-drdy>`
	will be	cleared, and the contents of this register become undefined until
	:ref:`DRDY <keyboard-drdy>` is set again.

Usage
-----

There are two ways of using the keyboard, polling and interrupt driven. Following
are simple descriptions of the usage patterns for both methodologies.

.. _keyboard-polling:

Polling Driven
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To use the keyboard in a polling based system, only a few steps are required:

1. Write ``0x01`` to the :ref:`control port <keyboard-control-port>` to enable the keyboard
2. Read from the :ref:`status port <keyboard-status-port>` and check if :ref:`DRDY <keyboard-drdy>` \
   is set.
3. If :ref:`DRDY <keyboard-drdy>` is set, then read from the :ref:`data port <keyboard-data-port>` to \
   get the ASCII representation of the key that was pressed.
4. If :ref:`DRDY <keyboard-drdy>` is not set, then go to step 2.

Interrupt Driven
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To use the keyboard in an interrupt based system, a different steps are required
than using the polling system.

1. Ensure the program loads the address of the keyboard ISR into memory address
   ``0x18``. This is the address of IRQ 9, which is executed on every keypress.
2. Write ``0x11`` to the :ref:`control port <keyboard-control-port>` to enable both the
   keyboard and keyboard interrupts.
3. The main program should now perform any background tasks that are required.
4. When a key is pressed, IRQ 9 will trigger the keyboard ISR that was installed in
   step 1.
5. The keyboard ISR should read the ASCII character from the :ref:`data register <keyboard-data-port>`.
6. The ISR must return by calling IRET to ensure the processor returns from the
   interrupt correctly, and resumes normal program execution.

    **Note: While interrupts are enabled, the HLT instruction will not terminate
    execution. This allows programs that use interrupts to put the processor to
    sleep pending an interrupt. The only way to terminate execution of programs
    while interrupts are enabled is to manually stop it.**

Known Issues
------------

* No events are triggered on key release.
* Non printable characters (arrow keys, backspace, shift, etc.) do not trigger interrupts
  or update the data register.
* No ability to update the *Lock* keys (scroll lock, num lock, caps lock) on the keyboard.
